/*
If we can't use additional data structures, we can do the following:
1. Compare every character of the string to every other character of the string.
This will take O( n2) time
and 0 (1) space.
2. If we are allowed to modify the input string, we could sort the string in
O( n log( nÂ» time and then linearly check the string for neighboring characters
that are identical. Careful, though: many sorting algorithms take up extra space.
