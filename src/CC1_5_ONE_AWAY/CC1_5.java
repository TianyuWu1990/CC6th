/**
 * Created by wutianyu on 6/15/17.
 * There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace
 * a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
 * EXAMPLE
 * pale, ple -) true
 * pales, pale - ) true
 * pale, bale -) true
 * pale, bae -) false
