/**
 * Created by wutianyu on 6/20/17.
 * Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (Le., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
 SOLUTION
 EXAMPLE
 Input: the node c from the linked list a- >b- >c - >d - >e- >f
 Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f
