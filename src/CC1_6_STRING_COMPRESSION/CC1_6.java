 * <p>
 * Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example,
 * the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed"string would not become smaller than the original
 * string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase
 * letters (a - z).
