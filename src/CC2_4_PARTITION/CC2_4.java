/**
 * Created by wutianyu on 6/20/17.
 * Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes
 * greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements
 * less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to
 * appear between the left and right partitions.
